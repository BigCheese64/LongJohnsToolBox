# LongJohnsToolBox:
Long John's Tool Box is a collection of tools built in mostly python to help clear out annoying tasks out of your life and spread annoyance into other's lives.
# Current Program List:
SpotifyToMP3 - Pretty self explanatory, gets the song names and artists of all the songs in a playlist and searches them on Youtube and then downloads them using ytmp3.cc<br/>
MangaDownloader - Downloads all avilable chapters of a manga from kissmanga.com into a file of images for reading offline<br/>
EmailSpam - Repeatedly sends emails to a target address until gmail decides that it doesn't like you and crashes the program after like 120 emails (requires enabling less secure apps in the sender's email, see email spams README for more details or just look up how to do it)<br/>
SignUp - Signs target email up for very annoying newsletters from multiple sites (still a work in progress)<br/>
# Dependencies:
Most of the python programs require the following:<br/>
Python 2.7 or 3.x (duh) www.python.org<br/>
Selenium and webdriver for your prefered browser(Note: I only programmed support for chrome and firefox in all the Long J's Tool Box programs because if you use Edge you don't deserve my code and if you use safari you're rich enough to afford an apple product so you dont need my code) - Instructions here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html<br/>
  Installers:<br/>
  There is a Windows installer for all the libraries in the works bc installing all the shit and adding it to Window's PATH is hell though you will need to download and install     python first.<br/>
  I might make a Linux installer if someone asks for it but until then it's not worth my time.<br/>
